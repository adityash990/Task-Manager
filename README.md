✅ Task Manager — Full-Stack, Dockerized, Kubernetes-Ready Application 🐳🚀
A scalable, full-stack Task Management platform featuring a Python-powered backend, React/TypeScript frontend, and full container orchestration with Docker & Kubernetes. Built to demonstrate real-world development, containerization, and cloud deployment principles.

✨ Key Features
✅ Full-Stack Architecture with separation of Frontend & Backend
✅ Python (FastAPI/Flask) backend with Docker containerization
✅ React & TypeScript frontend for modern, responsive UI
✅ Kubernetes (K8s) configuration for scalable, cloud-ready deployment
✅ Frontend hosted on Vercel with live demo mode for UI preview

🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools
Frontend: React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS (optional)

Backend: Python (Flask/FastAPI), RESTful APIs

Containerization: Docker, Docker Compose

Orchestration: Kubernetes (K8s), YAML manifests, Ingress setup

Deployment: Vercel (Frontend), Backend prepared for cloud deployment (AWS/GCP/Render)

CI/CD Potential: Project structured for continuous integration

🚀 Live Demo
👉 Visit Live Frontend (Demo Mode)
Note: Backend runs locally or via container; frontend shows demo functionality if backend is inactive.
